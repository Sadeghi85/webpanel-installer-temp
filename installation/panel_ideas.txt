bandwidth: inspired by vlogger, a script that processes nginx log files before midnight rotation and calculates daily bandwidth for each virtual-host and stores in a mysql table.

no need for apache and php access log, nginx access log is enough?

tailing nginx log to Piwik. it's possible. apparently it's more resource friendly to log to syslog-ng instead of file, from there it should be possible to write to file, import to Piwik and calculate bandwidth for virtual-hosts. it's possible with "mkfifo" which makes a named pipes and to nginx looks like a regular file. apparently if syslog-ng is not running when nginx starts, nginx will hang, so this needs to be taken into account.
